- quote: "The Internet is a decentralized ecosystem. Nevertheless, the platforms which are built on top of the Internet tend to monopolize it. Blockchain can help preserving Internet's decentralized nature. 
The Internet would not exist without open-source and still it is an uneasy task to find proper funding strategies to support open-source projects. Blockchain is bringing value directly attached to the code."
